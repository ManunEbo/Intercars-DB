<h1>Intercars background</h1>
<p>
Intercars Leicester is an ambitious car dealership based in Leicester.<br>
They are very active in auctions in the east and west midlands.<br>
They have basic data collection techniques which could be significantly<br>
improved to enable them to gain greater insight from the data they collect<br>
which would in turn drive profitable decisions.

<h3>The project</h3>
<p>
Intercars Leicester were approached with the concept of migrating all their<br>
data which at the time was kept in paper form into an on premises MySQL database<br>
with a dedicated server laptop which could be connected to from any other laptops<br>
via ssh or via a GUI. Note, the GUI is the second part of this discontinued project.<br><br>

To accomplishing the project, a few weeks were spent understanding how the<br>
business operates and what data they collect. After this period, the project<br>
blue print was drawn, see Intercars DB Concept_Sep2021.xlsx under Documents.<br><br>

Various tasks were undertaken to ensure that the eventual database was a<br>
summarised reflection of the business. Once the tables were designed, the<br>
combination of procedures and triggers were used for trafficking data<br>
to it's final destination.<br><br>

The project was certainly an enjoyable experience.
